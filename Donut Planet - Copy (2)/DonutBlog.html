            ○Sour End:
            <br>
            <br>
            Donut Planet will be going offline by the end of this year due to Replit throwing website hosting
            behind a pay wall, it will be impossible to host Donut Planet anymore. The changes will take effect
            on january 2024. As of right now all my work on Donut Planet has been completely paused for the past month
            or so. I will be hosting Donut planet on vercel now however it will be mostly an offline experience where you 
            won't be capable of interacting with others. I will also be transforming Donut Blog into a bigger Blog for me personally 
            that can keep you updated on me. Goodbye to everyone here, this is quite the sour end even dough donuts were always meant to be sweet.

                ○Update 1.4:
                <br>
                <br>
                Fully reworked the profile system and kind of removed the old profile. So now there is a homelounge which
                you will be taken to instead of a profile. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The home lounge is basically gonna be your own personal relaxing place
                within Donut Planet. It will be specifically tailored to you with many customization options and upcoming features.
                <br>
                <br>
                The old profiles are here to stay but they wont be focused on, you still have them and your designs are still saved so
                don't worry. You can visit your old profiles in the home area.
                <br>
                <br>
                 Welcome the new profiles, where by spending 5000 sprinkles you can buy your own customizable profile that can be viewed by
                 the entire Donut Planet Community. It will be yours! Your own creation. You can customize your bio, your poster,
                 your social links, your banner, your profile name and your profile picture specifically to what you desire! 
                 (As of right now I am yet to add the buying option, but its coming real soon.) Will also be adding badges to special profiles.

                <br>
                <br>
                Added home button, to Clicknut Confectionery, Donut Gallery and Donut Blog. Whenever anyone joins a hub now
                it has been changed back to say 'has glazed the hub' instead of 'has joined the hub' it was originally like that and I
                don't know why I even changed it.

                <br>
                <br>
               More content has been added to Clicknut Confectionery. Prices have been decreased to make the game
               more playable and less annoyingly grindy. There is now business status, purchase it to be capable
               of investing in different donut businesses! Take the risk and invest in a business you like. Will
               be adding more businesses in the future. Added some quality of changes which now allow you to close
               menus in Clicknut Confectionery by pressing a 'Close' button. Oh and also the skills you purchase will
               now be saved so you can revisit Clicknut Confectionery with your skills still on. Will be adding some more quality
               of life changes later

                <br>
                <br>
               Hey all, just finished up a very early version of a cookie clicker inspired donut planet 
               game which should help you get more sprinkles. Its in very early stages right now, so just
               test it out. Will be adding much more content later. Enjoy! (you should find it in the homepage)

                ○Back and Possible Roadmap for the rest of this year:
                <br>
                <br>
                After lots of thinking and consideration, I have decided to return to the development of Donut planet and
                I will be updating Donut planet with many new features I have in the back of my mind right now. Hopefully by
                the end of this year. Donut planet will be in what I consider a state that can be used by the majority of people
                as an actual social media website of their life.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, I will present my roadmap for the end of this year. Just keep in mind that I may not even work on any
                of this or even commit to any of it.
                <br>
                <br>
                - I might create a dark mode for Donut planet to make it easier on the eyes though I think the base colors are not too bright.
                <br>
                <br>
                - I will definitely be adding more collaborative things within the future, to make Donut Planet more social.
                <br>
                <br>
                - I plan on adding more features and things to do with Donut Gallery
                <br>
                <br>
                - Not really happy with the profile feature right now, might rework it fully later and give more use to sprinkles
                <br>
                <br>
                - Adding some games would be nice..
                <br>
                <br>
                Yeah thats all, take all of this with a very slight grain of salt cause I might not even make any changes this year.

                <br>
                <br>
                Hey all, I have decided to move on from donut planet. Donut planet is probably one of
                my favorite projects that I have ever worked on but I guess its time to experience some new bigger
                projects. Who knows though I might return later with some massive update! Though that won't happen any time soon.
                <br>
                <br>
                Goodbye even dough we barely got to know each other.

                <br>
                Changed up the intro page to make it more updated and related to current state Donut Planet.
                <br>
                <br>
                Donut Gallery is no longer opened in another tab. Added 6 more photos to view.

                <br>
                <br>
              Donut Delight Gallery has been fully reworked and is now known as Donut Gallery. Instead of people sending links and going through the tedious
              process of converting the link to an image. Donut Gallery allows people to look at 3 smoothly animated images of specific things like a specific artist.
              You the people of Donut Planet can submit your own images of a specific thing by reaching out to me on discord! donut48 is my username. Make sure that the images
              has the ratios of a phone background image and not a whole pc background image.

                <br>
                <br>
               Donut Chat 2: Now improved with the ability to send messages by pressing enter and now you can have profile pictures when messaging!
               <br>
               Quality of life updates: Now there is a button that can close the shop and edit section of the profile, you can still press escape to close them.
               Position of the profile button has been fixed so now it shouldn't drift into outer space

                <br>
               I fixed the overflow issues and have also decided to make the banner larger. It looks better this way and I am thinking of adding some little thing to the banner in a future update

                <br>
                I have been testing donut planet on different devices and I have noticed that on different devices
                the main website seems to look unorganized and I have encountered an issue with the profile page on all
                the devices that I tested donut planet on so in the next update I will be fixing those issues
